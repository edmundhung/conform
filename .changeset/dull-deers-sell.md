feat: add four new React hooks for form management:

- `useForm`: Main hook for form state, validation, and submission
- `useFormMetadata`: Access form-level metadata (errors, validation state)
- `useField`: Access individual field metadata with auto-generated IDs
- `useIntent`: Create intent dispatchers for programmatic form actions
