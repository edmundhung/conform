> Preview: [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/edmundhung/conform/tree/main/examples/remix) \| [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/edmundhung/conform/tree/main/examples/remix)

This example shows you how to integrate conform with Remix. It is almost the same as the [list](../list/) example except it is progressively enhanced by moving the parsing step to the server and populating the form with the result from the server.

It works without JS.
